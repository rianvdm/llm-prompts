# General instructions for completing tasks:

* Before starting implementation, provide an ELI5 explanation of what you're about to do
* Once implemented:
  	- Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
  	- Commit the changes to the repository with a clear commit message.
	- Explain what you did and what should now be possible. If I am able to manually test the latest change myself to make sure it works, give me instructions on how I can do that.
* Pause and wait for user review or feedback.

# Writing code

- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in a new item in `todo.md` instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without explicit permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new today will be "old" someday.

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.
- NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests, integration tests, AND end-to-end tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, you need the human to say exactly "I AUTHORIZE YOU TO SKIP WRITING TESTS THIS TIME"
